# Catan_Map_Generator
Tool to randomly generate maps for the board game Catan.

## Motivations
My family and friends love playing Catan but we sometimes complain about how unfiar some boards are. So I decided to create a random board generator so no one can complain about it being unfair anymore :)

## Features

*   Generates randomized resource tile distributions.
*   Shuffles number tokens for balanced resource production.
*   Randomized port placement for strategic trading.
